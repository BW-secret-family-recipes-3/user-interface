        <p>The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you ever start. I'm going to mix up a little color. We’ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue. It's a good way of getting rid of all your anxieties and hostilities. As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll. Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper.</p>
