                Physical cookbooks are a relic of the past. There's no sense lugging a heavy cookbook around that you risk losing. We believe that what's most important about grandma's favorite recipe is not the handwritten note itself, but the joy and thought that went into making that recipe. With Family recipes, you can preserve those precious family recipes and take them with you everywhere you go.
